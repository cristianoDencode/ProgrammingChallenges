## 🚀 About the Project

This repository serves as my personal Software Engineering laboratory. The concept is straightforward: I tackle programming challenges generated by Artificial Intelligence that simulate real-world scenarios of "legacy code" or "dirty code."

**The primary goal** is not just to solve the problem, but to evolve it to the state-of-the-art by applying:
- ✅ **Clean Code** - ✅ **SOLID Principles**
- ✅ **Design Patterns** (GoF, GRASP)
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** and high-level Object-Oriented Programming.

## 🛠️ Workflow

For every challenge, I follow this ritual:
1. **The Chaos:** I receive functional but unorganized and hard-to-maintain code (generated via AI prompt).
2. **The Analysis:** I identify *Code Smells* and violations of architectural principles.
3. **The Evolution:** I implement multiple solutions, testing different approaches and languages (starting with a focus on PHP 8.4+).

## 🐳 Infrastructure (Docker)

This lab runs on a dedicated Docker environment. It includes **PHP 8.5-FPM**, **Nginx**, and a **Web Terminal (ttyd)** for an integrated experience.

### 🎮 Commands

To manage the environment, navigate to the Docker folder:
`cd Docker/php-v85`

* **Start the Lab:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
* **Stop the Lab:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
* **Rebuild (after config changes):**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
    ```
* **Composer:**
```text    
In the ProgrammingChallenges/Challenges directory, accessed via the terminal at http://localhost:7681, run:   
```
```bash
composer install
```

### 🔗 Access Points
- **Dashboard:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Web Terminal:** [http://localhost:7681](http://localhost:7681)
