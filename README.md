## 🚀 About the Project

This repository serves as my personal Software Engineering laboratory. The concept is straightforward: I tackle programming challenges generated by Artificial Intelligence that simulate real-world scenarios of "legacy code" or "dirty code."

**The primary goal** is not just to solve the problem, but to evolve it to the state-of-the-art by applying:
- ✅ **Clean Code** - ✅ **SOLID Principles**
- ✅ **Design Patterns** (GoF, GRASP)
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** and high-level Object-Oriented Programming.

## 🛠️ Workflow

For every challenge, I follow this ritual:
1. **The Chaos:** I receive functional but unorganized and hard-to-maintain code (generated via AI prompt).
2. **The Analysis:** I identify *Code Smells* and violations of architectural principles.
3. **The Evolution:** I implement multiple solutions, testing different approaches and languages (starting with a focus on PHP 8.4+).

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each challenge lives in its own folder, structured for easy study:

```text
/Challenges

  │   ├── solution-v1/      # Refactoring focused on Design Patterns
  │   ├── solution-v2/      # Refactoring focused on Clean Architecture
  │   └── README.md         # Study notes and lessons learned
